# Galleries

## Status: Alpha/Incomplete

This is a photo gallery builder for the [Elefant CMS](http://github.com/jbroadway/elefant).
To install, unzip it into your apps folder, and you'll see
"Galleries (click to install)" appear in the Elefant Tools
menu. Click that to complete the installation. Afterwards
you'll be able to create photo galleries under Tools > Galleries
as a site admin.

To publish your galleries, either link to `/galleries` on your
website, or use the Dynamic Objects menu to embed a gallery or
slideshow of the gallery into any page of your site.
